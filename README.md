# Peek

**A recorder for Claude Code sessions.** You mark an interval. Peek captures every tool call, every subagent, every API request inside it — with inputs and outputs expandable from the UI. Nothing leaves your laptop.

---

## The problem

You're forty turns deep into a Claude Code session. The agent spawned the orchestrator subagent. The orchestrator fired off eighteen tool calls — some Bash, a couple of API hops, a few file reads — and decided there were "multiple repos" and went exploring. Something in there burned 40k tokens you didn't expect.

You press `Ctrl+O`. A wall of interleaved JSON scrolls by. The information is technically there. But it isn't navigable. You can't click a row. You can't compare two turns. You can't show it to a teammate without a screen-share and a lot of squinting.

Telemetry gives totals. Logs give noise. What you actually want is the *story* of what the agent did: in order, expandable, with the exact bash command and its stdout right there.

## What Peek does

You type `/peek_start fixing-auth`. You work normally. You type `/peek_end`. You refresh `http://127.0.0.1:7335` and see a timeline like this:

```
22:04:04  👥  SUBAGENT  Agent: orchestrator                 18 children  ▾
22:04:04  💬  USER_PROMPT  user_prompt                              150  ▸
22:04:06  🤖  API_CALL     api_call                                  13  ▾
          OUTPUTS  I'll start by exploring the working directory
                   to find git repositories.
22:04:07  ▸   TOOL_CALL    Bash                                       45  ▸
22:04:09  ▸   TOOL_CALL    Bash                                       74  ▸
22:04:11  🤖  API_CALL     api_call                                  31  ▾
          OUTPUTS  There are multiple repos. I need to determine
                   which one is "the current repository"…
```

Click any row. The panel slides open with the real command string (`ls /Users/.../Code/work`), the captured stdout, and the token count. Subagents collapse into groups with accurate child counts. Lifecycle noise is hidden by default; one toggle reveals it.

Peek is a screen recorder for your agents, but structured: events, not pixels. When a session goes sideways, you share the recording instead of describing what happened.

## Get it running

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22 or newer, and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and run at least once (so `~/.claude/` exists).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VatsalEnpal/peek.git
cd peek
npm install
npm run build
node dist/bin/peek.js install
node dist/bin/peek.js serve
```

You should see:

```
peek live on http://127.0.0.1:7335 (dataDir=~/.peek, watch=~/.claude/projects)
```

Open Claude Code. Type `/peek_start my-topic`. Do work. Type `/peek_end`. Refresh `http://127.0.0.1:7335`.

> **Heads up — known v0.3 limitation.** The recording picks the "current" Claude Code session by watching which JSONL was most recently appended. If you have multiple CC windows writing at the same time, a recording may briefly attribute to whichever one happened to blink last. For single-session workflows (almost everyone) this is invisible. If you're dogfooding Peek while debugging Peek in a second window — you'll want to close one or wait for v0.3.1, which makes the JSONL-side marker authoritative.

---

## The mental model

**Only sessions you explicitly record show up.** If you never type `/peek_start`, Peek's landing page stays empty no matter how much Claude Code activity your machine sees. Peek is a recorder, not an observatory.

Three rules keep it sane:

- **One recording at a time per session.** A second `/peek_start` auto-saves the previous one and starts fresh — like hitting record on a camcorder while already recording.
- **10-minute idle auto-close.** If you quit Claude Code or the session goes quiet, Peek closes the recording at the last event it saw.
- **Recording follows the session it was started in.** Other Claude Code sessions in other terminals are invisible unless you `/peek_start` inside them too.

## Text-marker fallback

Haven't installed the slash commands? Type markers inside your CC prompt:

```
@peek-start my-topic
…work normally…
@peek-end
```

The markers must be the *entire* prompt on their own. Inline usage (`"document the @peek-start flow"`) is deliberately ignored so your README diffs and your chat about Peek don't accidentally start recordings. Slash commands are the preferred flow; text markers are the fallback.

## What a recording does NOT include

- Other Claude Code sessions you didn't `/peek_start`
- Events in the same session from before `/peek_start` or after `/peek_end`
- Claude Code lifecycle noise (`permission-mode`, `file-history-snapshot`, `turn_duration`, `last-prompt`, ~10 siblings) — hidden by default. Toggle "show internal events" on the detail page to see them.

## Privacy

Peek binds to `127.0.0.1` only. No telemetry. No cloud. No login. Your recordings live under `~/.peek/`. Capture-time redaction hashes `.env` values and API-key-looking tokens before writing — even your local database never sees secrets in plaintext.

## Reference

### Commands

| Command              | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `peek`               | Start the recorder (HTTP + JSONL watcher) on `http://127.0.0.1:7335`. Equivalent to `peek serve`.         |
| `peek serve`         | Same as `peek` with explicit flags. Watcher runs by default; pass `--no-watch` to disable. `--port`, `--data-dir`, `--claude-dir` override the defaults. |
| `peek install`       | Copy `/peek_start` and `/peek_end` into `~/.claude/commands/`. `--force` overwrites. `--target <dir>` installs elsewhere (for testing). |
| `peek import <path>` | One-shot import of a JSONL file or directory. Only populates the legacy `/sessions` view — recordings still require `/peek_start`. |

### Environment variables

- `PEEK_PORT` — override the default port (`7335`). Honored by the daemon AND by the slash commands, so setting it once makes both ends match.
- `PEEK_DATA_DIR` — override `~/.peek/`. Useful for hermetic test runs or keeping recordings under a project tree.
- `PEEK_HOST` — override `127.0.0.1`. Use `0.0.0.0` only on trusted networks (containers, remote dev boxes).

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key                                   | Action                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `?`                                   | Open the help drawer                       |
| `Esc`                                 | Close any open drawer or modal             |
| `j` / `k` (or `↓` / `↑`)              | Next / previous row in the timeline        |
| `h` / `l` (or `←` / `→`)              | Collapse / expand the focused row          |
| `Enter`                               | Open / drill into the focused row          |
| `Cmd+Shift+R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R`        | Toggle recording                           |

### Routes

- `/` — the recordings list (what you made with `/peek_start`)
- `/recording/:id` — the full detail view for one recording
- `/sessions` — legacy view of every imported Claude Code session (for `peek import` users)

### Troubleshooting

**`peek: daemon not running — start with "peek"`**
The daemon isn't running. Open another terminal and run `peek`. Leave it running while you work.

**Port 7335 already in use**
Another process owns the port. Either stop it, or run `PEEK_PORT=7336 peek` — the slash commands honor the same env var so they still hit the right daemon.

**`~/.claude/ not found`**
`peek install` couldn't find Claude Code's config directory. Install Claude Code, run it once, then retry `peek install`. Fallback: copy `skills/peek_start/SKILL.md` and `skills/peek_end/SKILL.md` into `~/.claude/commands/peek_start.md` and `peek_end.md` yourself.

**Slash commands installed but `/peek_start` does nothing**
Restart Claude Code. It scans `~/.claude/commands/` only on startup.

**Recording stays empty**
Check that `peek` was already running *before* you typed `/peek_start`. Events that were appended to the JSONL before the start marker are out of the recording window.
